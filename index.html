                        <p>His breathing became heavier with each step he took into the unknown, pagan forest.
                        His guides were the 'funny placed' rocks, shaped as tall pointy figures that, in the past, probably resembled people-like deities.
                        More and more, the dense mist infiltrated his lungs. The chanting became clearer. The detective was getting nearer.
                        He stopped for a minute to plan his entrance, then held the amulet that the enchantress gave him.
                        His heart was beating fast against his hand. He then held his breath, hoping the chanting would be witches dancing naked.
                        He chanced it, hopping willingly to what he would later regret.

                        <p>One of the chanting people stood up.<br>
                        'Hold it! Who are you?'<br>
                        'I'm detective…'<br>
                        A woman interrupted and stood up in pure frustration:<br>
                        'Detective! You need to leave.'<br>
                        All the cloaked members of the circle stood up and started walking towards him.<br>
                        'I came prepared. I'm not afraid of you!'<br>
                        He said as he reached for his coat pocket.<br>
                        'Guns won't work here.' Said one of the chanting people.<br>
                        'I know this is sacred ground; I know what you do here. I can undo your ritual in a blink of an eye. Just let me talk to him.'<br>
                        He showed them the amulet, and the frustrated woman snatched it from his hand.<br>
                        'You…' Before the detective could finish that sentence, she loudly reprimanded:<br>

                        <p>'Enough! You have the guts and the knowledge, but there is a clear reason why you came here alone. You knew this would fail. I could sense your soldier spirit coming in for a good attempt at nothing. This isn't your battle detective. If you don't learn to accept that, things will carry on the same. Your lover won't be more than your confidant, your job will be unsatisfactory, you will only get the unsolvable cases no one wants…'<br>
                        She kept cursing him until the spirits of the forest lifted him up. The woman extended her arms and weighed him down without touching him. Her odd-looking-nailless grey hands began to tremble while performing a choking-like motion towards him. He kept gasping for air while losing his vision.<br>
                        'SAY HER NAME. WHO IS PROTECTING YOU?!' She exclaimed.
